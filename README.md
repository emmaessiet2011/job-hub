## About The App

The Nigeria Hub careers page is a demonstration of a modern portal for attracting talent in the HealthTech space. It features a striking hero section that clearly communicates the organization's mission, followed by a clean, card-based layout for individual job roles. Each job card provides essential details like title, location, and job type, along with a brief description and relevant skill tags.

Key functionalities include:
- **Engaging Hero Section:** A compelling header inspired by the provided mockup, designed to attract top talent.
- **Interactive Job Cards:** Each card has dedicated buttons that link to a Trello board for more detailed job descriptions and a Microsoft Form for direct applications.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Users can easily filter job openings by type (e.g., Full-time, Contract, Internship) to quickly find relevant positions.
- **Graceful Loading State:** A skeleton loader provides a better user experience by showing a content placeholder while job data is being fetched.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** The "View Available Roles" button smoothly navigates the user to the job listings section.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using modern frontend technologies:

- **React:** For building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
- **TypeScript:** For adding static typing to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid and custom UI development.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the core structure and styling, including custom animations.
